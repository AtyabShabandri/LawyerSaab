This project introduces a state-of-the-art tuned LLM, implemented with the cutting-edge GPT-4 architecture and leveraged with Llama-Index for precise data retrieval. This chatbot is specifically trained on Indian Constitutional Law and a spectrum of legal documentation.

The chatbot incorporates advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) capabilities, empowering it to understand complex queries and generate comprehensive, coherent, and accurate responses. It is an invaluable tool that delivers prompt access to a vast array of information in the domain of Indian Constitutional Law and various legal documentations, eliminating the need for time-consuming manual search and analysis.

Key Features:

Deep Learning with GPT-4: The model uses the revolutionary GPT-4 language model developed by OpenAI for understanding and generating human-like text. GPT-4, with its enhanced learning abilities, ensures improved context understanding and response generation.

Training on Domain-specific Data: The model is trained specifically on Indian Constitutional Law and a range of legal documents, making it a domain-specific AI tool with extensive legal knowledge.

Llama Index Integration: Llama Index is used as a powerful information retrieval tool that allows the chatbot to fetch the most relevant answers from its extensive training data. This feature significantly improves the chatbot's accuracy

The innovation encapsulated within this project reflects a significant stride towards harnessing AI's potential in the legal domain. It not only stands to streamline research and education in Indian Constitutional Law but also introduces an era of digital transformation in the wider legal field.

In the future I plan to train it on a more robust data source, run the model on a cloud instance for faster responses, train it on LlaMa2 instead of GPT-4 and condense this all into a open-source api.

You can clone this repo and try it either data of your own or run a few test questions on it.

    the deceased feached near the Kamla Tile Industry village Talwara then he collided with the tanker/tipper bearing No. PB-12-M-9609 which was parked on the road without any parking lights or indicators. Due to said collusion the deceased fell down on the road and received grievous injuries 
    on his head and died at the spoi. The ys deceased was immediately taken to BBMB Hospital Nangal by his brother who was also coming behind the deceased on his separate, motorcycle bearing No. PB-12-R-5602, but the doctors of BBMB Hospital Nangal has declared Gurmail Singh brought dead. 
    The postmortem of the deceased was conducted by the docots of BBMB Hospital on 28-05-2019. . That the said accident entirely took place due to the wrong parking of the tipper bearing No. PB-12-M-9609 by its driver i.e. respondent No.2 which was wrongly parked by the respondent No.2 without any parking . 
    lights or any indicator. That the accident was witnessed by Hajara Singh son of Swarna brother of the deceased and on the statement of Hajara Singh an FIR No. 0037 dated 28-05-2019 under section 283, 304-A, 427 IPC was registered against the respondent No. 1 in PS Nangal. 
    Therefore the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants.
